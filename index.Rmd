## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring the relationship between GDP growth and democratizaation in Kazakhstan.I hypothesize that GDP growth allows democratic progress to occur through factors such as increased governmental capacity, heightened foreign investment, strengthened economic and political institutions, and a more stable middle class. I will use data from VDem to supplement my analysis.
